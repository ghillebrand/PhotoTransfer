# PhotoTransfer
MediaTransfer App in Python

Requires 
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ExifRead 
and 
  https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download
  
Still need to check versions, but this was developed on Windows 7 with the 64 bit versions of these libaries.

exifread and MediaInfoDLL3 must be in the same path as Rename&TransferMedia.py

Target dirs are still hardcoded in setupDirCopy(), but you are prompted for the source dir

Rename only code can be uncommented in main()

Very basic version
